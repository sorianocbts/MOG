    "Chapter 1": [`
    1 The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible a
rule of all saving
knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light b
of nature, and the works of creation
and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave
men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will
which is necessary unto salvation. c
Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in
divers manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church; and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice
of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto d
writing; which maketh the
Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God’s revealing his will unto
his people being now ceased.

8 THE LONDON CONFESSION
3 The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of f
divine inspiration, are no part
of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of
God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings. (
f Luk
24:27,44; Rom 3:2)
4 The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, dependeth not
upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon g
God (who is truth itself),
the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it is the Word of God. ( g 2Pe
1:19-21; 2Ti 3:16; 2Th 2:13; 1Jo 5:9)
5 We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to an high and
reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy
of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the
whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of
man’s salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire perfections
thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God;
yet notwithstanding, our h
full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine
authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with
the Word in our hearts.
(
h Joh 16:13-14; 1Co 2:10-12; 1Jo 2:20,27)
6 The whole counsel of God concerning all things i
necessary for his own glory, man’s
salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily contained in the Holy
Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of
the Spirit, or traditions of men.
Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward k
illumination of the Spirit of God to be
necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word, and
that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of
the church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be l
ordered by the
light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word,
which are always to be observed.

Joh 6:45; 1Co 2:9-12; l
1Co 11:13-14; 14:26,40)
7 All things in Scripture are not alike m
plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all; yet
those things which are necessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so n
clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the
learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient
understanding of them. (

2Pe 3:16; n Psa 19:7; 119:130)
8 The Old Testament in o
Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God
of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most
generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular
care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore p
authentic; so as in all controver-
Confession of Faith of 1689 9
sies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. q
But because these original
tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in
the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read r
and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they s
come, that the Word of God dwelling t
plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.

Act 15:15; r

1Co 14:6,9,11-12,24,28; t
Col 3:16)
9 The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the u
Scripture itself; and therefore
when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not
manifold, but one), it must be searched by other places that speak more clearly. (
u 2Pe
1:20-21; Act 15:15-16)
10The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and
all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits,
are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy
Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which x
Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally
resolved.
