Therefore, the Holy Scriptures are absolutely necessary, because God&#8217;s former ways of revealing his will to his people have now ceased.<sup>4</sup></p>`,

                    `<p>4. The authority of the Holy Scriptures obligates belief in them.

Therefore, the Scriptures are to be received because they are the Word of God.<sup>7</sup></p>`,

                [`<p>5. The testimony of the church of God may stir and persuade us to adopt a high and reverent respect for the Holy Scriptures. Moreover, the heavenliness of the contents, the power of the system of truth, the majesty of the style, the harmony of all the parts, the central focus on giving all glory to God, the full revelation of the only way of salvation, and many other incomparable qualities and complete perfections, all provide abundant evidence that the Scriptures are the Word of God. Even so, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority of the Scriptures comes from the internal work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<sup>8</sup></p>`,

    Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the inward illumination of the Spirit of God is necessary for a saving understanding of what is revealed in the Word.<sup>10</sup> We recognize that some circumstances concerning the worship of God and government of the church are common to human actions and organizations and are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian wisdom, following the general rules of the Word, which must always be observed.<sup>11</sup></p>`,

These Testaments were inspired directly by God and by his unique care and providence were kept pure down through the ages. They are therefore true and authoritative<sup>a</sup>, so that in all religious controversies the church must make their ultimate appeal to them.<sup>15</sup> All God’s people have a right to and a claim on the Scriptures and are commanded in the fear of God to read<sup>16</sup> and search them.<sup>17</sup>  Not all of God’s people know these original languages, so the Scriptures are to be translated into the common language of every nation to which they come.<sup>18</sup>  In this way the Word of God may dwell richly in all, so that they may worship him in an acceptable manner and through patience and the comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.<sup>19</sup></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>a</sup><em>authentical</em><br />`,

These effects are the natural fruits of this assurance.<sup>11</sup>  Thus, it does not at all encourage believers to be negligent.<sup>12</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>9</sup>Isaiah 50:10; Psalms 88; 77:1–12. <sup>10</sup>1 John 4:13; Hebrews 6:11, 12. <sup>11</sup>Romans 5:1, 2, 5; 14:17; Psalms 119:32. <sup>12</sup>Romans 6:1, 2; Titus 2:11, 12, 14.</p>`],

                [`<p>5. The moral law forever requires obedience of everyone, both those who are justified as well as others.<sup>10</sup>  This obligation arises not only because of its content but also because of the authority of God the Creator who gave it.<sup>11</sup> Nor does Christ in any way dissolve this obligation in the Gospel; instead he greatly strengthens it.<sup>12</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>10</sup>Romans 13:8–10; James 2:8, 10–12. <sup>11</sup>James 2:10, 11. <sup>12</sup>Matthew 5:17–19; Romans 3:31.</p>`],

True believers are not under the law as a covenant of works, to be justified or condemned by it.<sup>13</sup>  Yet it is very useful to them and to others as a rule of life that informs them of the will of God and their duty. It directs and obligates them to live according to its precepts. It also exposes the sinful corruptions of their natures, hearts, and lives. As they examine themselves in light of the law, they come to further conviction of, humiliation for, and hatred of sin,<sup>14</sup> along with a clearer view of their need for Christ and the perfection of his obedience. The law is also useful to the regenerate to restrain their corruptions because it forbids sin. The punishment threatened by the law shows them what even their sins deserve and what troubles they may expect in this life due to their sin, even though they are freed from the curse and undiminished severity of it. The promises of the law likewise show them God&#8217;s approval of obedience and the blessings they may expect when they keep it, even though these blessings are not owed to them by the law as a covenant of works. If people do good and refrain from evil because the law encourages good and discourages evil, that does not indicate that they are under the law and not under grace.<sup>15</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>13</sup>Romans 6:14; Galatians 2:16; Romans 8:1; 10:4. <sup>14</sup>Romans 3:20; 7:7, etc; <sup>15</sup>Romans 6:12–14; 1 Peter 3:8–13.</p>`],

                [`<p>1. The catholic—that is, universal—church may be called invisible with respect to the internal work of the Spirit and truth of grace. It consists of the full number of the elect who have been, are, or will be gathered into one under Christ her head. The church is the spouse, the body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.<sup>1</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>1</sup>Hebrews 12:23; Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 1:10, 22, 23; Ephesians 5:23, 27, 32</p>`],

                [`<p>2. All people throughout the world who profess the faith of the gospel and obedience to God through Christ in keeping with the gospel are and may be called visible saints,<sup>2</sup> as long as they do not destroy their own profession by any foundational errors or unholy living. All local<sup>a</sup> congregations ought to be made up of these.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>a</sup><em>particular</em> (rendered “local” throughout this chapter)<br />`, `<sup>2</sup>1 Corinthians 1:2; Acts 11:26. <sup>3</sup>Romans 1:7; Ephesians 1:20–22.</p>`],

                [`<p>3. The purest churches under heaven are subject to mixture and error.<sup>4</sup> Some have degenerated so much that they have ceased to be churches of Christ and have become synagogues of Satan.<sup>5</sup> Nevertheless, Christ always has had and will have in this world to the very end a kingdom of those who believe in him and profess his name.<sup>6</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>4</sup>1 Corinthians 5; Revelation 2; Revelation 3. <sup>5</sup>Revelation 18:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12. <sup>6</sup>Matthew 16:18; Psalms 72:17; Psalm 102:28; Revelation 12:17.</p>`],

                [`<p>4. The Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church. By the Father’s appointment, all authority is conferred on him in a supreme and sovereign manner to call, institute, order and govern the church.<sup>7</sup>  The Pope of Roman Catholicism cannot in any sense be head of the church; rather, he is the antichrist, the man of lawlessness, and the son of destruction, who exalts himself in the church against Christ and all that is called God. The Lord will destroy him with the brightness of his coming.<sup>8</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>7</sup>Colossians 1:18; Matthew 28:18–20; Ephesians 4:11, 12. <sup>8</sup>2 Thessalonians 2:2–9.</p>`],

                [`<p>5. In exercising the authority entrusted to him, the Lord Jesus, through the ministry of his Word,  by his Spirit, calls to himself out of the world those who are given to him by his Father.<sup>9</sup>  They are called so that they will live before him in all the ways of obedience that he prescribes for them in his Word.<sup>10</sup>  Those who are called he commands to live together in local<sup>a</sup> societies, or churches, for their mutual edification and the fitting conduct of public worship that he requires of them while they are in the world.<sup>11</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>9</sup>John 10:16; John 12:32. <sup>10</sup>Matthew 28:20. <sup>11</sup>Matthew 18:15–20.</p>`],

                [`<p>6. The members of these churches are saints by calling, visibly displaying and demonstrating in and by their profession and life their obedience to the call of Christ.<sup>12</sup>  They willingly agree to live together according to Christ’s instructions, giving themselves to the Lord and to one another by the will of God, with the stated purpose of following the ordinances of the Gospel.<sup>13</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>12</sup>Romans. 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:2. <sup>13</sup>Acts 2:41, 42; Acts 5:13, 14; 2 Corinthians 9:13.</p>`],

                [`<p>7. To every church gathered in this way, conforming to Christ’s mind as declared in his Word, he has given all power and authority that is in any way necessary to conduct the form of worship and discipline that he has instituted for them to observe. He has also given them commands and rules to use and carry out that power rightly and properly.<sup>14</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>14</sup>Matthew 18:17, 18; 1 Corinthians 5:4, 5; 1 Corinthians 5:13; 2 Corinthians 2:6–8.</p>`],

                [`<p>8. A local<sup>a</sup> church, gathered and fully organized according to the mind of Christ, consists of officers and members. The officers appointed by Christ are overseers or elders, and deacons. They are to be chosen and set apart by the church called and gathered in this way, for the distinctive purpose of administering ordinances and for carrying out any other power or duty Christ entrusts them with or calls them to. This pattern is to be continued to the end of the age.<sup>15</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>15</sup>Acts 20:17, 28; Philippians 1:1.</p>`],

                [`<p>9. Christ has appointed the way to call someone prepared and gifted by the Holy Spirit to the office of overseer or elder in a church. He must be chosen by the collective vote of the church itself.<sup>16</sup>  He must then be solemnly set apart by fasting and prayer. The body of elders of the church must lay hands on him if there are any already in place.<sup>17</sup>  A deacon must be chosen by the same kind of vote and set apart by prayer and laying on of hands as well.<sup>18</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>16</sup>Acts 14:23. <sup>17</sup>1 Timothy 4:14. <sup>18</sup>Acts 6:3, 5, 6.</p>`],

                [`<p>10. The work of pastors is to give constant attention to the service of Christ in his churches in the ministry of the word and prayer. They are to watch over the souls of church members as those who must give an account to Christ.<sup>19</sup>  The churches to whom they minister must not only give them all due respect but also must share with them from all their good things according to their ability.<sup>20</sup>  They must do this so their pastors may have a comfortable living without having to be entangled in secular matters<sup>21</sup> and so they can show hospitality to others.<sup>22</sup>  This is required by the law of nature and by the explicit command of our Lord Jesus, who has ordained that those who preach the Gospel should earn their living by the Gospel.<sup>23</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>19</sup>Acts 6:4; Hebrews 13:17. <sup>20</sup>1 Timothy 5:17, 18; Galatians 6:6, 7. <sup>21</sup>2 Timothy 2:4. <sup>22</sup>1 Timothy 3:2. <sup>23</sup>1 Corinthians 9:6–14.</p>`],

                [`<p>11. Although overseers or pastors of churches must be engaged in preaching the word as a function of their office, yet the work of preaching the word is not totally restricted to them. Others who are also gifted and prepared by the Holy Spirit for it and approved and called by the church may and should preach.<sup>24</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>24</sup>Acts 11:19–21; 1 Peter 4:10, 11.</p>`],

                [`<p>12. All believers are obligated to join themselves to local<sup>a</sup> churches when and where they have the opportunity. Likewise, all who are admitted to the privileges of a church are also subject to the discipline<sup>b</sup> and government of it, according to the rule of Christ.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>b</sup><em>censures</em><br />`, `<sup>25</sup>1 Thessalonians 5:14; 2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14, 15.</p>`],

                [`<p>13. Church members who have been offended and have performed their duty concerning the person by which they are offended, should not disrupt any church action or absent themselves from the assemblies of the church or administration of any ordinances because of the offence at any of their fellow members. Instead, they should look to Christ in the further action of the church.<sup>26</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>26</sup>Matthew 18:15–17; Ephesians 4:2, 3.</p>`],

                [`<p>14. Every church and all its members are obligated to pray continually for the good and prosperity of all churches of Christ in every place.<sup>27</sup>  They must also—at every opportunity within the limits of their stations and callings—exercise their gifts and graces to benefit every church. Also, when churches are raised up by the providence of God, insofar as they enjoy opportunity and favorable circumstances for it, they should have fellowship<sup>c</sup> among themselves for their peace, growth in love, and mutual edification.<sup>28</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>c</sup><em>communion</em>, implying formal association<br />`, `<sup>27</sup>Ephesians 6:18; Psalms 122:6. <sup>28</sup>Romans 16:1, 2; 3 John 8–10.</p>`],

                [`<p>15. Cases of difficulties or differences—doctrinal or administrative—may arise, touching on the peace, union, and edification of all churches in general or an individual church. Other cases may occur when a member or members of a church are injured in or by disciplinary action that is not in keeping with truth and order. In such cases, it is according to the mind of Christ for many churches having fellowship<sup>c</sup> together to meet through their messengers to consider and give their advice concerning the issue in dispute and to report their advice to all the churches concerned.<sup>29</sup> Nevertheless, these assembled messengers are not entrusted with any church authority, strictly speaking. Neither do they have any jurisdiction over the churches themselves, to exercise any discipline either over any churches or individuals or to impose their decision on the churches or officers.<sup>30</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>29</sup>Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22, 23, 25. <sup>30</sup>2 Corinthians 1:24; 1 John 4:1.</p>`],

                [`<p>1. All saints are united to Jesus Christ their head by his Spirit and by faith, although this does not make them one person with him. They have fellowship in his graces, sufferings, death, resurrection, and glory.<sup>1</sup>  Since they are united to one another in love, they have communion in each other’s gifts and graces<sup>2</sup> and are obligated to carry out these duties, both public and private, in an orderly way to promote their mutual good, both in the inner and outer aspects of their lives.<sup>3</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>1</sup>1 John 1:3; John 1:16; Philippians 3:10; Romans 6:5, 6. <sup>2</sup>Ephesians 4:15, 16; 1 Corinthians 12:7; 1 Corinthians 3:21–23. <sup>3</sup>1 Thessalonians 5:11, 14; Romans 1:12; 1 John 3:17, 18; Galatians 6:10.</p>`],

                [`<p>2. Saints by profession are obligated to maintain a holy fellowship and communion in worshiping God and in performing other spiritual services that promote their mutual edification.<sup>4</sup>  They are to aid each other in material things according to their various abilities and needs.<sup>5</sup>  They should especially exercise communion in the relationships they have in their families<sup>6</sup> and churches.<sup>7</sup>  Yet the rule of the gospel also directs them, as God provides opportunity, to extend their sharing to the whole household of faith, to all those who in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus. Nevertheless, their communion with one another as saints does not take away or infringe on the title or individual ownership that people have in their goods and possessions.<sup>8</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>4</sup>Hebrews 10:24, 25; Hebrews 3:12, 13. <sup>5</sup>Acts 11:29, 30. <sup>6</sup>Ephesians 6:4. <sup>7</sup>1 Corinthians 12:14–27. <sup>8</sup>Acts 5:4; Ephesians 4:28.</p>`],

                [`<p>1. Baptism is an ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ. To those baptized it is a sign of their fellowship with him in his death and resurrection, of their being grafted into him,<sup>1</sup> of remission of sins,<sup>2</sup> and of submitting themselves to God through Jesus Christ to live and walk in newness of life.<sup>3</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>1</sup>Romans 6:3–5; Colossians 2:12; Galatians 3:27. <sup>2</sup>Mark 1:4; Acts 22:16. <sup>3</sup>Romans 6:4.</p>`],

                [`<p>1. The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night he was betrayed. It is to be observed in his churches to the end of the age as a perpetual remembrance and display of the sacrifice of himself in his death.<sup>1</sup>  It is given for the confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits of Christ’s death, their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, and their further engagement in and to all the duties they owe him. The supper is to be a bond and pledge of their communion with Christ and each other.<sup>2</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>1</sup>1 Corinthians 11:23–26. <sup>2</sup>1 Corinthians 10:16, 17, 21.</p>`],

                [`<p>2. In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor is any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the living or the dead. It is only a memorial of the one offering Christ made of himself on the cross once for all.<sup>3</sup>  It is also a spiritual offering of the highest possible praise to God for that sacrifice.<sup>4</sup> Thus, the Roman Catholic sacrifice of the mass (as they call it) is utterly detestable and detracts from Christ&#8217;s own sacrifice, which is the only propitiation for all the sins of the elect.</p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>3</sup>Hebrews 9:25, 26, 28. <sup>4</sup>1 Corinthians 11:24; Matthew 26:26, 27.</p>`],

                [`<p>3. In this ordinance the Lord Jesus has appointed his ministers to pray and to bless the elements of bread and wine and in this way to set them apart from a common to a holy use. They are to take and break the bread, take the cup, and give both to the communicants while also participating themselves.<sup>5</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>5</sup>1 Corinthians 11:23–26, etc.</p>`],

                [`<p>4. Denying the cup to the people, worshipping the elements, lifting them up or carrying them around for adoration, or reserving them for some pretended religious use are all contrary to the nature of this ordinance and to the institution of Christ.<sup>6</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>6</sup>Matthew 26:26–28; 15:9; Exodus 20:4, 5.</p>`],

                [`<p>5. The outward elements in this ordinance, properly set apart for the use ordained by Christ, have such a relationship to Christ crucified that they are sometimes called—truly though figuratively—by the names of the things they represent, that is, the body and blood of Christ.<sup>7</sup>  However, in substance and nature they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.<sup>8</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>7</sup>1 Corinthians 11:27. <sup>8</sup>1 Corinthians 11:26–28.</p>`],

                [`<p>6. The doctrine commonly called transubstantiation teaches that the substance of bread and wine is changed into the substance of Christ&#8217;s body and blood by the consecration of a priest or some other way. This doctrine is hostile not only to Scripture<sup>9</sup> but also to common sense and reason. It destroys the nature of the ordinance and has been and is the cause of many kinds of superstitions and of gross idolatries.<sup>10</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>9</sup>Acts 3:21; Luke 24:6, 39. <sup>10</sup>1 Corinthians 11:24, 25.</p>`],

                [`<p>7. Worthy recipients who outwardly partake of the visible elements in this ordinance also by faith inwardly receive and feed on Christ crucified and all the benefits of his death. They do so really and truly, yet not physically and bodily but spiritually. The body and blood of Christ are not present bodily or physically in the ordinance but spiritually to the faith of believers, just as the elements themselves are present to their outward senses.<sup>11</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>11</sup>1 Corinthians 10:16; 11:23–26.</p>`],

                [`<p>8. All ignorant and ungodly people are unfit to enjoy communion with Christ and are thus unworthy of the Lord&#8217;s table. As long as they remain in this condition, they cannot partake of these holy mysteries or be admitted to the Lord’s table without committing a great sin against Christ.<sup>12</sup> All those who receive the supper unworthily are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment on themselves.<sup>13</sup></p>`, `<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>12</sup>2 Corinthians 6:14, 15. <sup>13</sup>1 Corinthians 11:29; Matthew 7:6.</p>`],
